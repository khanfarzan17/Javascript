///JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. In a dynamically typed language, variable types are determined at runtime, and you can assign values of different types to the same variable. JavaScript allows you to change the type of a variable during the execution of your program.//


// let f="Hello World ";// f is being assign as String//
// console.log(f);

// f=12;// f is being assign as number///
// console.log(f);


// Using Symbols 

let ID=Symbol('123');

let accountID=Symbol('123');

console.log(ID===accountID);
